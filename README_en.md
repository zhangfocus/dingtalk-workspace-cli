<h2 id="why-dws">Why dws?</h2>

**For humans** — stop writing raw API calls. `dws` gives you `--help` on every resource, `--dry-run` to preview requests, and structured output in table/JSON/raw formats.

**For AI agents** — every response is structured JSON. Pair it with the included agent skills and your LLM can manage DingTalk Workspace without custom tooling.

```bash
# Search for a contact
dws contact user search --keyword "Alice"

# Create a todo item
dws todo task create --title "Prepare quarterly report" --executors "<userId>"

# Preview an operation without executing
dws todo task list --dry-run

# JSON output for agent consumption
dws contact user search --keyword "Alice" -f json
```

## Installation

### One-line install (recommended)

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

> Auto-detects OS and architecture, downloads the pre-built binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli/releases), and installs Agent Skills to `~/.agents/skills/dws` — no Go, Node.js, or other dependencies required. Most AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) can discover skills from the `.agents/skills/` directory.

> [!TIP]
> The binary is installed to `~/.local/bin` by default. If `dws` is not found after installation, add it to your PATH:
> ```bash
> export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
> ```
> Add this line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` to make it permanent.

### Pre-built binary (manual)

Download the latest binary for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli/releases).

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli.git
cd dingtalk-workspace-cli
make build
./dws version
```

This builds the binary only. To also install agent skills into your home directory:

```bash
sh scripts/install.sh
```

This detects the local source checkout and installs both the binary and skills without downloading from GitHub.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create a DingTalk Application

Go to the [Open Platform App Development Console](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com/fe/app?hash=%23%2Fcorp%2Fapp#/corp/app). Under "Internal Enterprise Apps - DingTalk Apps", click **Create App** in the top right corner to create a new application.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01VIkwvV1a5NQzCIFO0_!!6000000003278-2-tps-2690-1462.png" alt="Create Application" width="600">
</p>

### Step 2: Configure Redirect URL

After creating the app, go into the app settings and click **Security Settings**. In the "Redirect URL (Callback Settings)" section, enter `http://127.0.0.1` and save.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN017xQGWb1ycrAG0uxBO_!!6000000006600-2-tps-2000-1032.png" alt="Configure Redirect URL" width="600">
</p>

### Step 3: Publish the Application

Click "App Release - Version Management & Release", publish a version to make the app go live.

</p>

### Step 4: Request Whitelist Access

Refer to the [Co-creation Phase notice](#important) at the top of this page to join the DingTalk DWS co-creation group and complete whitelist configuration.

### Step 5: Login with Credentials

Once you have the AppKey and AppSecret, specify them via CLI flags:

```bash
dws auth login --client-id <your-app-key> --client-secret <your-app-secret>
```

Alternatively, set via environment variables:

```bash
export DWS_CLIENT_ID=<your-app-key>
export DWS_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-app-secret>
dws auth login
```

> [!NOTE]
> CLI flags take precedence over environment variables. These credentials are used for the OAuth device flow authentication with DingTalk.

### Token Encryption

Tokens are encrypted at rest using **PBKDF2 (600,000 iterations) + AES-256-GCM**, keyed by your device MAC address.

## Quick Start

```bash
dws auth login                                    # authenticate with DingTalk
dws contact user search --keyword "Alice"           # search contacts
dws calendar event list                            # list calendar events
dws todo task create --title "Prepare quarterly report" --executors "<userId>"   # create a todo
```

## AI Agent Skills

The repo ships agent skills (`SKILL.md` files) for every supported DingTalk product.

Skills are installed automatically by the [Installation](#installation) scripts. To install skills separately into an existing project:

```bash
# macOS / Linux — install only skills into the current project
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli/main/scripts/install-skills.sh | sh
```

The one-line installer (`install.sh`) installs skills to `~/.agents/skills/dws` (home directory).
Use `install-skills.sh` when you want to seed a specific project repository with `./.agents/skills/dws` (current working directory).

> [!NOTE]
> **Home vs. project skills**: `install.sh` places skills in `$HOME/.agents/skills/dws`. `install-skills.sh` installs into the **current working directory** (`./.agents/skills/dws`), which is useful for seeding a specific project repository.

## Advanced Usage

### Output Formats

All commands support multiple output formats:

```bash
# Table (default, human-friendly)
dws contact user search --keyword "Alice" -f table

# JSON (for agents and piping)
dws contact user search --keyword "Alice" -f json

# Raw API response
dws contact user search --keyword "Alice" -f raw
```

### Dry Run

Preview the MCP tool invocation without executing:

```bash
dws todo task list --dry-run
```

### Output to File

```bash
dws contact user search --keyword "Alice" -o result.json
```

### Shell Completion

```bash
# Bash
dws completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/dws

# Zsh
dws completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_dws"

# Fish
dws completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/dws.fish
```

## Environment Variables

Common runtime and development overrides:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `DWS_CONFIG_DIR` | Overrides the default config directory |
| `DWS_SERVERS_URL` | Points discovery at a custom server registry endpoint |
| `DWS_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth client ID (DingTalk AppKey) |
| `DWS_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth client secret (DingTalk AppSecret) |
| `DWS_TRUSTED_DOMAINS` | Comma-separated list of trusted domains for bearer token injection (default: `*.dingtalk.com`). Set to `*` for development only |
| `DWS_ALLOW_HTTP_ENDPOINTS` | Set to `1` to allow HTTP (non-TLS) for loopback addresses during development |

## Exit Codes

| Code | Category | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 0 | Success | Command completed successfully |
| 1 | API | MCP tool call or upstream API failure |
| 2 | Auth | Authentication or authorization failure |
| 3 | Validation | Invalid input, flags, or parameter schema mismatch |
| 4 | Discovery | Server discovery, cache, or protocol negotiation failure |
| 5 | Internal | Unexpected internal error |

When `-f json` is used, error responses include structured payloads with `category`, `reason`, `hint`, and optional `actions` fields for machine consumption.

## Architecture

`dws` uses a **discovery-driven pipeline** — no product commands are hardcoded:

```
Market Registry ──► Discovery ──► IR (Canonical Catalog) ──► CLI (Cobra) ──► Transport (MCP JSON-RPC)
      │                 │
      ▼                 ▼
  mcp.dingtalk.com   Cache (TTL + stale fallback)
```

1. **Market** — fetches the MCP server registry from `mcp.dingtalk.com`
2. **Discovery** — resolves runtime server capabilities with disk cache and stale-fallback for offline resilience
3. **IR** — normalizes servers into a canonical product/tool catalog
4. **CLI** — mounts the catalog onto a Cobra command tree, maps flags to MCP input parameters
5. **Transport** — executes MCP JSON-RPC calls with retries, auth injection, and response size limits

All output — success, errors, and metadata — is structured JSON when using `-f json`.

## Development

```bash
make build                        # dev build
make test                         # unit tests
make lint                         # formatting + lint checks
make package                      # build all release artifacts locally (goreleaser snapshot)
make release                      # build and publish a release via goreleaser
make publish-homebrew-formula     # push dist/homebrew/dingtalk-workspace-cli.rb to a tap repo
```

### Package Manager Artifacts

Build and verify local package-manager artifacts:

```bash
make package                                       # generates all platform archives, npm assets, Homebrew formulas
./scripts/release/verify-package-managers.sh        # verifies dws binary + skills are included
```

## Testing

### CLI Tests

Run the full CLI test suite (unit, golden, and integration tests):

```bash
bash test/scripts/run_all_tests.sh --jobs 8
```

### Packaging Tests

Run packaging contract tests and local package-manager verification:

```bash
go test ./test/scripts/... -count=1
make package
./scripts/release/verify-package-managers.sh
```

### Skill Tests

After installing the skills, use [`test/skill_tests.md`](./test/skill_tests.md) to verify them. Feed the test prompts from that file to your AI agent and confirm the expected outputs.
